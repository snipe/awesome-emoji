This is collection of the emoji I have collected from the interwebs that I use in all of my slack teams. (There is one that is too big for slack, but is so cute I can't exclude it, which is the `miyazaki/soot-sprites.gif` below).

Because OMG.

They're mostly pop culture, including Adventure Time, NES Zelda and Mario Brothers, Futurama, and misc internet memes. Enjoy!
